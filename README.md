This module leverages advanced deep learning techniques to detect and mitigate sophisticated cyberattacks with high precision. Using AI-driven behavioral analysis, it continuously monitors incoming requests to identify malicious patterns in real time. 

Key Functions:

✅ Intelligent SQL Injection Detection – Analyzes database query behavior to flag and neutralize SQL injection attempts.

✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Defense – Identifies script injection attacks targeting web applications and prevents unauthorized code execution.

✅ Command Injection Protection – Detects anomalous command executions to block exploitation of system vulnerabilities.

✅ Adaptive Threat Learning – Continuously improves detection accuracy by dynamically updating its knowledge base using AI-driven threat intelligence.

✅ Seamless Integration with WS Security Framework – Works alongside other Whale Sentinel security components to provide proactive attack prevention, high-speed anomaly detection, and automated response mechanisms.
